REM @brief Automated build and execution script for Cybersecurity Incident Response Console
REM
REM @details This batch script provides a complete automation solution for compiling,
REM testing, and running the Cybersecurity Incident Response Console application.
REM The script performs a four-stage process to ensure the application is properly
REM built and tested before execution.
REM
REM The script executes the following stages:
REM 1. Compilation: Compiles all Java source files in the current directory
REM 2. Testing: Runs the SimpleTestRunner to validate core functionality
REM 3. Application Launch: Starts the main SecurityConsole application
REM 4. Cleanup: Provides user feedback and waits for user input before exit
